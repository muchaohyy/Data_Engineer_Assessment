# Python Environment and Setup

### Environment:
- **Python Version**: 3.10.12

### Required Packages:
- `psycopg2`
- `pandas`

To install the necessary packages, use the following command:

```bash
pip install psycopg2 pandas
```

# Database Connection
### Ensure you update the following variables in the code to connect to the database:

- `host`
- `database`
- `user`
- `password`

# Code Overview
### **PostgreSQL Database Connection:**
- Initialise a connection to the PostgreSQL database..
- Execute SQL queries.

### **Duplicates Check:**
- Check for duplicates in the table by using either specific columns or all columns.

### **Data Type Checks:**
- Validate the column data types:
    - **Binary Check:** Verify if the column contains only binary values (0/1).
    - **Numerical Check:** Check if the column contains numerical values.
    - **Timestamp Check:** Confirm the column contains timestamp values.

### **Mandatory Fields Check:**
- Ensure that mandatory fields are filled, either by checking specific columns or all columns.

### **Logic Checks:**
- Volume Check: Ensure the `volume` column values are greater than 0.
- Time Logic Check: Confirm that the `close_time` is greater than `open_time`.

### **Cross-Reference Check:**
- Verify that the `login_hash` and `server_hash` values in the `trades` table also exist in the `users` table.

# **SQL Environment and Assumptions**
### SQL Environment:
- **Database:** PostgreSQL

### Assumptions:
- The `close_time` is considered in all calculations, as trades with a `close_time` are assumed to be completed records.

# **Future Improvements**
### Pre-Load Data Validation:
- The current Python code performs QA checks at the table level. To reduce downstream impacts, data validation should ideally be performed before loading the data into tables.

### Extend Data Sources:
- The Python code can be modified to read data from other sources beyond PostgreSQL by adding new classes to interact with different data sources.

### Big Data Support:
- If handling large datasets, the logic may need to be optimized, or a solution like `Apache Spark` could be used to efficiently process large volumes of data.

### AWS Integration:
- Since the database is hosted in an AWS PostgreSQL instance, the Python code can be deployed in AWS as well. `AWS SSM` (Systems Manager) can be used to securely store and retrieve the database credentials.

### CI/CD Pipeline:
- With the code version-controlled in GitHub, a CI/CD pipeline can be set up using `GitHub Actions` for continuous integration and deployment.
